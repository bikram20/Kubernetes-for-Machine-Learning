# Chapter 1: Basics of GPU

This chapter introduces you to GPU technology, starting from installation to understanding both hardware and software components. We'll install drivers, run some GPU-based tasks, and explore key concepts of GPU architecture.

## Pre-requisite
Before we start, ensure you have a Ubuntu 22.04 server/desktop with an NVIDIA GPU. We're using a Paperspace Core VM (www.paperspace.com), but any similar setup, including your local machine, will work. Just ensure you have SSH access to the VM.

Paperspace offers UI and CLI for machine creation. Choose a server with the vanilla Ubuntu 22.04 image and note that this setup will be used up to chapter 3. From chapter 4 (Kubernetes), we'll switch to a new VM setup.

After connecting to your VM, verify the presence of NVIDIA cards:

### CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture)
CUDA is a bridge for executing parallel computations on the GPU. It runs primarily on the CPU and manages the execution of code on the GPU. The runtime and compiler interpret, compile, and schedule the execution of kernels, which are the portions of code running on the GPU. This enables CUDA to use the CPU for orchestration while leveraging the GPU's parallel processing power.

CUDA is crucial for GPU application development. While containers often bundle CUDA libraries, we'll install it directly on our VM. Ensure compatibility between the CUDA library, hardware, and driver. Download CUDA from NVIDIA's website, choosing the version that matches your system and driver.

## See the GPU in action

After setting up the GPU, let's run some example codes to witness the power of GPU computing.

We will compare a 10000x10000 matrix multiplication on both CPU and GPU, utilizing CUDA and Tensor cores for the GPU computation.

PyTorch is required to run the matrix multiplication code. Install it using Python3 and pip:

</details>

When experimenting with matrix multiplication on the GPU, you'll notice a remarkable speedup compared to the CPU, particularly when the matrix dimensions exceed a certain threshold, such as 10,000. This illustrates the GPU's efficiency in handling large-scale parallel computations.

The NVIDIA A4000 GPU comes with 16GB of GPU RAM. When dealing with large matrices, say of size 40,000, the memory requirement exceeds the available GPU RAM. For instance, a 40,000-size matrix needs approximately 17.88 GB of RAM (calculated as 40000 x 40000 x 4 x 3 Bytes / (1024^3)). If you try to process a matrix size that significantly exceeds the GPU's memory capacity (e.g., 50,000), the program will fail due to insufficient memory.

Interestingly, PyTorch manages to handle a matrix size of 40,000 efficiently, thanks to its intelligent memory management techniques like streaming computation and memory swapping. However, these techniques have their limits.

Efficiency of Tensor Cores
Tensor cores, integral to modern NVIDIA GPUs, are optimized for half-precision (FP16) computations, using half the memory compared to standard precision (FP32). But it's important to note that even though tensor cores are more memory-efficient, doubling the matrix size doesn't directly double the feasible computation size. This is because the number of elements in a matrix increases fourfold when you double its dimensions.

Tensor cores perform a specialized operation per GPU clock cycle known as fused multiply-add (FMA). This operation involves multiplying two 4x4 FP16 matrices and adding the result to a 4x4 FP32 accumulator matrix. This capability makes tensor cores particularly effective for neural network computations, where such operations are frequent.

## GPU Concepts

GPUs are sophisticated systems-on-chips designed for high-efficiency computing. Unlike CPUs, GPUs consist of thousands of simpler processors, each equipped with its own set of registers, dedicated memory, and cache. They do not run an operating system themselves but are controlled through drivers and tools installed on the host OS, such as Linux or Windows.

User applications, especially those with parallelizable components, can significantly benefit from GPU acceleration. This is evident in tasks like matrix multiplication, where GPUs can perform computations much faster than traditional CPUs. In the realm of software development, this acceleration is achieved through specialized libraries like CuDNN, optimized for neural network operations, which in turn utilize CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture).

Neural networks represent a rapidly expanding area of GPU application. From 2013 to 2020, the size of neural networks has grown exponentially, often by as much as 75 times annually. Given this growth, many neural network models exceed the capacity of a single GPU. To address this, both software and hardware solutions have been developed. On the software side, tools like distributed TensorFlow, PyTorch Distributed Data Parallel (DDP), and Ray are used. For hardware, technologies like NVLink, which connects NVIDIA GPUs within a system, and NVSwitch, which connects GPUs across multiple hosts, are becoming standard in large-scale model training.

Over time, GPUs have seen significant advancements to enhance their efficiency in neural network training and inferencing. These include innovations like 16-bit computation and 8-bit integer-based inferencing. NVIDIA, in particular, has been at the forefront, evolving its GPUs to support these advanced capabilities directly on the chip.

In contrast to conventional CPUs, which are constantly active, GPUs are designed to be idle unless specifically called upon by an application. This idleness poses a challenge, especially in environments with multiple GPUs that might not be in constant use. To address this, NVIDIA has developed features for time-sharing or multi-tenancy, allowing multiple users or applications to share GPU resources effectively, ensuring that these powerful resources are utilized efficiently and economically.



### Micro-Architecture Evolution in GPUs

Much like their CPU counterparts, GPUs undergo constant evolution in their micro-architecture. This evolution aims to enhance their computational power and efficiency. Key areas of advancement typically include:

- **Increased Compute Capacity**: This is achieved by integrating more transistors within the same surface area, allowing for greater processing power without increasing the size of the chip.

- **Enhanced Memory Capabilities**: Modern GPUs feature high-speed and increased memory capacity, crucial for handling larger datasets and more complex computations, especially prevalent in machine learning and graphics processing.

- **Improved Connectivity**: Advancements in high-speed buses, like PCIe, enhance the communication speed between the GPU and the host system. Additionally, better interconnect technologies between GPUs (like NVLink and NVSwitch) facilitate efficient data transfer in multi-GPU setups, which is essential for scaling up computational tasks.

- **Specialized Computing Units**: The introduction and expansion of tensor cores and support for 8-bit inferencing optimize GPUs for specific tasks like neural network computing. These specialized cores are tailored to accelerate the types of calculations most commonly used in modern AI algorithms.

In the context of NVIDIA, the last three micro-architectures – Ampere, Lovelace, and Hopper – represent significant milestones in GPU development.

- **Ampere Architecture**: This architecture is known for its balanced improvements in computation, memory bandwidth, and energy efficiency. Popular GPUs like the GeForce RTX 3090, A4000, and A100 fall under this architecture, offering robust performance for both gaming and professional applications.

- **Lovelace Architecture**: (Details about the Lovelace architecture, if available, would be elaborated here, focusing on its unique features or improvements over Ampere.)

- **Hopper Architecture**: Representing the latest in NVIDIA's GPU technology, the Hopper architecture, exemplified by the recently released H-100, introduces new levels of computational efficiency and capabilities, particularly in the realm of AI and large-scale data processing.

For a deeper understanding of these architectures, one can explore their specific features and innovations on resources like [NVIDIA's microarchitecture Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Nvidia_microarchitectures).


### Understanding GPU Specifications

Understanding the specifications of your GPU is crucial for optimizing its performance and aligning it with your computational needs. 

For a detailed overview of your GPU's capabilities, you can refer to its product specification sheet. For instance, the NVIDIA RTX A4000's specifications are available in its datasheet, which provides comprehensive information about its architecture, memory, performance capabilities, and more. 

- [NVIDIA RTX A4000 Datasheet](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/gtcs21/rtx-a4000/nvidia-rtx-a4000-datasheet.pdf)

An alternative and more hands-on way to understand your GPU's specifications is by querying the device directly using CUDA's `deviceQuery` program. This approach gives you real-time, specific information about your GPU's configuration and capabilities.

##### Steps to Install and Run deviceQuery

<details>

1. **Clone the CUDA Samples Repository:**
   Clone the NVIDIA CUDA samples repository, which contains the deviceQuery program.
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the deviceQuery Directory:**
   ```shell
   cd cuda-samples/Samples/1_Utilities/deviceQueryDrv
   ```

3. **Compile the deviceQuery Program:**

### Calculating the Theoretical Performance of NVIDIA A4000 GPU
Understanding the computational power of a GPU like the NVIDIA A4000 requires delving into its core specifications and performance metrics. Let's explore how to calculate the theoretical Floating Point Operations Per Second (FLOPS) for the A4000, a key indicator of its performance capabilities.

The NVIDIA A4000 features 48 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), each with 128 CUDA cores, amounting to a total of 6144 CUDA cores. These cores can be thought of as simple processors, similar to Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs) in CPUs.

- **GPU Clock Rate**: The A4000 has a maximum clock rate of 1560 MHz.
- **FLOPS per CUDA Core**: Each CUDA core is capable of performing 2 FLOPS (floating-point operations) per clock cycle.

Thus, the maximum theoretical FLOPS for the A4000 can be calculated as:

```
Total CUDA Cores x Clock Rate x FLOPS per Core
= 6144 Cores x 1.56 GHz x 2
= 19169 GigaFLOPS
= 19.2 TeraFLOPS
```

This calculation gives us the maximum single-precision performance of the CUDA cores. For more detailed specifications, you can refer to the [A4000 Datasheet](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/gtcs21/rtx-a4000/nvidia-rtx-a4000-datasheet.pdf).

Apart from CUDA cores, the Ampere architecture of A4000 also includes tensor cores, which are specialized for certain types of computations like those used in neural networks.

We can take another approach to arrive at the benchmark in the datasheet for both CUDA cores and tensor cores. From figure 2 of [GPU architecture fundamentals](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/dl-performance-gpu-background/index.html#gpu-arch), we can use the benchmark numbers per streaming multiprocessor (SM).


- **Performance per SM**: According to [NVIDIA's documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/dl-performance-gpu-background/index.html#gpu-arch), each SM in the Ampere architecture can achieve:
  - 256 FP16 FLOPS with CUDA Cores.
  - 2048 FP16 FLOPS with Tensor Cores.
  
Therefore, the overall performance in TFLOPS for both CUDA and Tensor cores can be calculated as follows:

- **CUDA Cores Performance**:
  ```
  (256 FP16 FLOPS x 48 SMs x 1.56 GHz) / 1000 = 19.2 TFLOPS
  ```
  
- **Tensor Cores Performance**:
  ```
  (2048 FP16 FLOPS x 48 SMs x 1.56 GHz) / 1000 = 153.3 TFLOPS
  ```

These calculations align with the performance benchmarks provided in the A4000's datasheet and offer insights into how the GPU's FLOPS are estimated.

### Hardware Perspective on GPUs

#### CPU vs. GPU Architectures
While a typical CPU comprises several cores, each capable of handling multiple threads, GPUs are designed with a different objective in mind. GPUs are optimized for SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations, enabling them to execute thousands of parallel tasks efficiently. This capability is central to their architecture and the CUDA ecosystem.

#### Streaming Processors and CUDA Cores
A GPU is organized into Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), with each SM containing a number of CUDA cores. For instance, the NVIDIA A4000 GPU has 48 SMs, each with 128 CUDA cores. These CUDA cores are analogous to Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs) in CPUs and are the primary units of computation on the GPU.

- **Shared Memory and L2 Cache**: Each SM includes shared memory, which is accessible to all CUDA cores within that SM. Additionally, the entire GPU board features a L2 cache and global GPU memory, facilitating data storage and retrieval for ongoing computations.

#### Registers and Thread Execution
An interesting aspect of GPU architecture is the variable allocation of registers to threads. SMs possess a register file, from which registers are dynamically allocated to threads based on their computational requirements. This flexibility allows for the effective management of memory resources during different tasks.

#### Tensor Cores: The Next Generation of GPU Computing
Tensor cores, another critical component of modern GPUs, are specialized for certain types of computations such as those found in neural networks and machine learning models. For example, in the NVIDIA H-100 GPU, tensor cores are optimized for efficiently executing operations essential for training and inferencing of transformer models (like Large Language Models).

- **Efficient Task Switching**: When a thread executing on a CUDA core requires a matrix multiply-add (MMA) operation, it can be seamlessly transferred to a tensor core. The tensor core can perform the entire MMA operation in one cycle, with the thread's register state preserved in the register file, thus eliminating the need for data movement.

#### Scheduling and Parallelism
Unlike CPUs, GPUs contain thousands of cores to handle the massively parallel nature of their tasks. Consequently, the unit of scheduling in GPUs is a 'warp', typically consisting of 32 threads. This approach ensures that large numbers of threads can be managed and executed concurrently, which is crucial given the parallel processing nature of GPU tasks.

- **Thread vs. Core**: It's important to distinguish between a thread and a core. A thread is a sequence of programmed instructions, whereas a core is the physical unit executing these instructions. The GPU scheduler efficiently manages the concurrent execution of multiple threads across the available cores, accommodating the varying demands of different computational tasks.


### Software Perspective on GPU Computing with CUDA

#### Role of CUDA
CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) acts as the pivotal controller for GPU-based computing. It fulfills several critical functions:

1. **Low-Level API Provisioning**: CUDA offers a set of low-level APIs for developers and frameworks, facilitating direct interaction with the GPU's hardware capabilities.

2. **Scheduling at the SM Level**: It handles the scheduling of computational tasks (or kernels) across the various Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) within the GPU.

3. **GPU Management and Maintenance**: CUDA is responsible for the overall management and maintenance of the GPU, ensuring efficient operation and resource allocation.

#### Host-Side Operations
From a software development perspective, the primary focus is on how programs execute on the GPU:

- **Kernel Definition**: Developers use high-level frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow to define kernels, which are functions intended to be executed on the GPU. These kernels are written using abstractions that allow developers to focus on the computational aspects without needing to manage low-level hardware interactions.

- **Compilation and Translation**: The framework's compiler translates this high-level kernel code into lower-level CUDA code, tailoring it to the GPU's architecture and instruction set. This process includes determining the optimal organization of blocks and threads based on the computational workload.

- **Data Transfer**: To facilitate GPU computations, the framework manages the transfer of necessary data from the CPU's memory to the GPU's memory.

- **Kernel Launching**: The framework then launches the compiled kernel using CUDA API calls, specifying parameters such as grid size, block size, and the amount of shared memory required for the task.

#### GPU-Side Operations
Once the kernel is launched, CUDA takes over on the GPU side:

- **Block Assignment**: The CUDA scheduler assigns computational blocks to the available SMs. This decision is based on factors like the current workload on each SM, the availability of resources (such as CUDA cores, tensor cores, and shared memory), and the locality of the required data.

- **Warp Scheduling**: Within each SM, a warp scheduler manages the execution of threads. Warps, which are groups of threads, are assigned to available execution units (CUDA cores or tensor cores). The scheduler is responsible for handling context switching between threads and ensuring that each instruction is executed correctly.

- **Tensor Core Utilization**: For operations suitable for tensor cores (like mixed-precision computations), the warp scheduler identifies and assigns eligible threads to these specialized cores. This includes managing the efficient transfer of data between CUDA cores and tensor cores, optimizing the overall computation process.


In this chapter, we covered the fundamental aspects of GPUs, from their architecture and parallel processing capabilities to the role of CUDA in managing GPU tasks. By exploring example of a matrix multiplication, we've seen the GPU's power in handling parallelizable tasks. We also reviewed the evolution of GPU technology and its impact on computing efficiency. This foundation sets the stage for better understanding and leveraing GPUs in Kubernetes.
